The 11 subtitles of the Code cover the different types of federal taxes including income, estate, gift and excise taxes. These code sections are the ultimate authority on federal taxes and all your tax forms and instructions are based on it.
      The IRC also sets out the procedural and administrative rules that both taxpayers and the IRS must follow. For example, it provides the due date of your return and the amount of time the IRS has to audit you.`]
